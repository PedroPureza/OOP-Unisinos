# OOP-Unisinos

Github repo for my OOP classes at Unisinos-Porto Alegre

Code is in python because that's what the professor is using. Also, even though this readme is in English,
the code will be written with variable names in Portuguese because that's what the classes are taught in.


### Important Notes:

Each folder is a separate exercise list, should be easy to understand based on the name :)
This is just a introduction to OOP, so no packages or external tooling is needed. Just clone the repo and run it normally.

Nem todas as listas estar√£o aqui nesse repo.
